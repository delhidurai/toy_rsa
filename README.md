## Step 1:-
## Implement Utility crate that uses toy_rsa_lib and implement RSA encryption and decryption
Developed an utility crate lib.rs that will utilize toy_rsa_lib functions and perform encryption and decryption of a given message.
The Utility will have the below public functions
genkey() -> This function will generate two private keys (Prime numbers), which will be used by the RSA algorithm for encryption and decryption.
encrypt() -> This function utilizes toy_rsa_lib modexp(), to encrypt the given message using the Public key (Which is a product of the two private keys generated by genkey)
decrypt() -> This function utilizes toy_rsa_lib modinverse, lcm, modexp and  decrypt the given encrypted message using private keys. 

## Step 2:-
## Testing  the code
Create random.rs that has testcases to unit test the Utility crate. 
Executing test functions
Use
```bash
$ cargo test 
```
If testing under debug mode to view the println's
Use
```bash
$ cargo test -- --nocapture
```
## Step 3:-
## Create Stand alone examples/toyrand.rs to run the crate through command line

Use
```bash
$ cargo run --example toyrand 12345

```
## Step 4:-
## Formatting the code through cargo fmt and cargo clippy
Use 
```bash
$ cargo fmt 
```
to format the code and 

```bash
$ cargo clippy 
```
